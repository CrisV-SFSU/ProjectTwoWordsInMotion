# Project Two: Words In Motion

by Cristian Vasquez

# Project Overview
For this project, I was tasked to create an animated experience using purely text.
The text chosen had to speak to our own views on community.

For my chosen text, I selected these lyrics from Skid Row's "Youth Gone Wild":

When I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall, ain't never a doubt
We are the young (Hey), so shout it out


They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
(We are the youth gone wild)
We stand and we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
(We are the youth gone wild)

For me, community's all about having each other's backs and being resilient in the face of adversity. These lyrics speak to that notion exactly. 

In the experience, you'll see text fade in to aid in pacing. The timing of the fade ins are also meant to mimick the pacing of the original song. Words are also animated to either scale or move across the page, this was to help emphasize the meaning of the words themselves.

My typography is also in your face, especially with the typeface Showdex, which mimicks the typeface used in Skid Row's branding. The color choice of red is also to mimick their brand.

# Technical Overview

The languages used are HTML & CSS. 

For the animations, I primarily used @keyframes to get more control over my animations & timing. The animations are also quick, ranging from 1 second to 9 seconds primarily. 

All of the animations are stored in specific CSS classes that are applied to div elements in the HTML. This was to give me more control over animating different parts of the text.
